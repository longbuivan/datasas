### Library

- CORS - a technique that permits restricted resources on a web page to be accessed from a different domain (a case that occurs when you are creating an Express API).
- Express - a Node.js framework that enables us to create API endpoints, and to request data from the server. Express will help us write different functions that will help us process different CRUD requests.
